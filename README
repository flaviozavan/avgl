avgl is a simple tv viewer for Linux. It uses SDL, v4l and OpenGL. It's primary
goal is to display the image captured by EasyCap cards on the screen with the
shortest delay possible, enabling users to play video games using their cards.

avgl does not support sound, it is recommended to plug directly into the sound
card's microphone in and use alsamixer to unmute the microphone, as alsa
introduces a considerable delay when getting the audio through the capture
card.

Because playing video games only uses the rca or the s-video connectors, avgl
does not support channel switching or anything that is not necessary to just
play video games.

$ avgl -h
